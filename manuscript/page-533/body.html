She adores it; I may say that her whole soul and mind are wound up, and entwined with it. She has produced some delightful pieces, herself, sir. You may have met with her “Ode to an Expiring Frog,” sir.’</p><p>‘I don’t think I have,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p><p>‘You astonish me, Sir,’ said Mr. Leo Hunter. ‘It created an immense sensation. It was signed with an “L” and eight stars, and appeared originally in a lady’s magazine. It commenced—</p><p>‘“Can I view thee panting, lying
   On thy stomach, without sighing;
   Can I unmoved see thee dying
     On a log
     Expiring frog!”’</p><p>‘Beautiful!’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p><p>‘Fine,’ said Mr. Leo Hunter; ‘so simple.’</p><p>‘Very,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p></div> </div>
