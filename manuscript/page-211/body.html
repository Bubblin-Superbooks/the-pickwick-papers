   That creepeth oâ€™er ruins old!
   Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,
   In his cell so lone and cold.
   The wall must be crumbled, the stone decayed,
   To pleasure his dainty whim;
   And the mouldering dust that years have made,
   Is a merry meal for him.
        Creeping where no life is seen,
        A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,
   And a staunch old heart has he.
   How closely he twineth, how tight he clings
   To his friend the huge Oak Tree!
   And slily he traileth along the ground,
   And his leaves he gently waves,
   As he joyously hugs and crawleth round
