   Has a far sweeter sheen for me, I ween,

   So let Autumn air be never so fair,
   It by no means agrees with me.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">‘But my song I troll out, for <em>Christmas</em> Stout,
   The hearty, the true, and the bold;
   A bumper I drain, and with might and main
   Give three cheers for this Christmas old!
   We’ll usher him in with a merry din
   That shall gladden his joyous heart,
   And we’ll keep him up, while there’s bite or sup,
   And in fellowship good, we’ll part.
   ‘In his fine honest pride, he scorns to hide
   One jot of his hard-weather scars;
   They’re no disgrace, for there’s much the same trace
