If it doesn’t, I’ll take her abroad for a little while, and see what that’ll do.’</p><p>‘Oh, the aunt’s is in Bristol, is it?’ faltered Mr. Winkle.</p><p>‘No, no, not in Bristol,’ replied Mr. Ben Allen, jerking his thumb over his right shoulder; ‘over that way—down there. But, hush, here’s Bob. Not a word, my dear friend, not a word.’</p></div> </div>
