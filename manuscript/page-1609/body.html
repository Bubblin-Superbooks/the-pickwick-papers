   His bold mare Bess bestrode—er;
   Ven there he see’d the Bishop’s coach
   A-coming along the road—er.
   So he gallops close to the ‘orse’s legs,
   And he claps his head vithin;
   And the Bishop says, ‘Sure as eggs is eggs,
   This here’s the bold Turpin!’</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
